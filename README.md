## Vuldroid Exploit Application
#### Initial push for my exploit solutions to the vulnerable problems presented by the [Vuldroid](https://github.com/jaiswalakshansh/Vuldroid) application. A better description (+ more detailed writeup) will be provided some time later. Some of the exploits covered require user interaction with the vulnerable app, thus needs to be installed as well. Download the vulnerable apk from the provided link to the repo.
